## Repository content and how to use

**To change the model set up:** <br />
- 'Parameters.m' : the main parameter values of the simulations can be modified here, including the value of the first order correction coefficient 'epsilon'. This does not include numerical scheme-specific parameters, which can be modified in the respective files for simulating the macroscopic (SimPDE) and microscopic (SimMC) models. This function is called from the files:  MICRO_SimMC_1D.m, MICRO_SimMC_1D_tot.m, MICRO_SimMC_2D.m, MACRO_SimPDE_1D.m, MACRO_SimPDE_2D.m. 


### Simulating the microscopic model

The code is set up to simulate the microscopic model (1)-(2) described in Section 2 of LorenziEtAl2024Modelling, under the numerical setup detailed in Section 4.1 of LorenziEtAl2024Modelling. <br />

**To simulate the microscopic model:** <br />
- 'MICRO_SimMC_1D.m' : file to run Monte Carlo simulations of the microscopic model in 1D  <br />
- 'MICRO_SimMC_1D_tot.m' : file to run Monte Carlo simulations of the microscopic model in 1D, including interactions in which both phenotypic switching and directional changes occur (results shown in Section 4.2.1). This is an effect of order Dt^2, and in our model set up it yields the same results as in 'MICRO_SimMC_1D.m' (this was thoroughly checked), because phenotypic changes only depend on phenotype and not on velocity, thus simulating the phenotypic switch before the change in velocity accounts for both particles only switching phenotype and those switching both phenotype and velocity. <br />
- 'MICRO_SimMC_2D.m' : file to run Monte Carlo simulations of the microscopic model in 2D (results shown in Section 4.2.1)  <br />


### Simulating the macroscopic model

The code is set up to simulate the PDE (52) in LorenziEtAl2024Modelling, under the numerical setup detailed in Section 4.1 of LorenziEtAl2024Modelling. 

**To simulate the macroscopic model:** <br />
- 'MACRO_SimPDE_1D.m' : file to run for simulations of the macroscopic model in 1D (results shown in Section 4.2.1) <br />
- 'MACRO_SimPDE_2D.m' : file to run for simulations of the macroscopic model in 2D (results shown in Section 4.2.2) <br />
- 'Nonlocal_advection_1D.m' : function called from within the 'MACRO_Sim_1D.m' file to calculate the advection velocity U_T and the variance-covariance matrix D_T appearing in PDE (52) in 1D <br />
- 'Nonlocal_advection_2D.m' : function called from within the 'MACRO_Sim_2D.m' file to calculate the advection velocity U_T and the variance-covariance matrix D_T appearing in PDE (52) in 2D <br />
- 'MUSCL_GP.m' : function called from within 'MACRO_Sim_1D.m' and 'MACRO_Sim_2D.m' to compute the numerical approximation of the flux of PDE (52) using the MUSCL scheme. Go to this function to change the flux-limiter to use for the simulation. <br />


### Reproducing plots from LorenziEtAl2024Modelling

The data produced by simulations that is used to obtain the plots in LorenziEtAl2024Modelling is provided in the repository in the folder 'Saved data'. We first detail how to reproduce these figures from scratch and then clarify which simulations the different data files are storing results of. <br />

**To reproduce the figures in Section 4.2 of LorenziEtAl2024Modelling:** <br />
- 'Plot_comparison_1D_eps.m' : file to reproduce figure 2. One must first run  'MICRO_SimMC_1D_tot.m' (or  'MICRO_SimMC_1D.m') and 'MACRO_SimPDE_1D.m' for the different values of 'epsilon' that should be plot and save the data.
- 'Plot_comparison_2D.m' : file to reproduce figure 3. One must first run  'MICRO_SimMC_2D.m' and 'MACRO_SimPDE_2D.m' for the chosen value of 'epsilon' that should be plot and save the data.
- 'Plot_stripes.m' : function to reproduce figures 4 and 5. This function is called from within 'MACRO_Sim_2D.m' to plot results, so just run that file with the chosen set up. <br />
